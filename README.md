## Summery
This project sets up boilerplate for using: 

- [Netlify lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda)
- Apollo federation & gateway

Functions code is inspired and forked from this [repo](https://github.com/bkegley/intro-to-graphql-meetup)

### Start

`ntl dev` 

This starts three lambda functions that federated by `@apollo/federation` and `@apollo/gateway`.
